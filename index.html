            This is my Portfolio and below I will show you some examples of my coding abilites. While I'll show some of my code 
            on this page, <a href="https://sackman21.itch.io/escape-the-dragon-city" >here</a> is a link to play the example code.

        <h2>Code Example</h2>
        
        <p>
            Here is an example of a player movement code that I created using C# and using the Unity Engine.
            The portion of the code that is visable is controlling the horizontal movement of the character by allowing
            the A and D keys to move, while pressing the corrosponding button changing the direction the charcter is facing, 
            and it checks if the character is on a surface to be able to jump. 
            I will gladly be available to send more examples at request, <a href="contact.html">contact</a> me today.

        <h2> Heres a screenshot from my game!</h2>
        <img id="Game" src="images/GameScreenShot.png" alt="GameScreenShot" >
        <p>
            While I am unable to show a video of my game, I will have a screenshot here as well as a link to play it above. 
            I do not have a large artistic ability so I will be showing off my programming and level design skills. 
            I have used all the base assets that Unity has to my abilities and I have used free assets to show my design skills. 
            This should show my level of programming knowledge as I am able to make a playable game with only using the base assets.
