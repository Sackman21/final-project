            My name is Joshua Sackett and I am currently studying Games and Interactive Media
            at Michigan State University. I am currently learning how to use the Unity engine to the
            highest capabilities and I have knowledge of C#. I will be graduating in the fall of 2025
            with a Bachelor's Arts in Games and Interactive Media. I am a quick learner and I 
            am happy to learn new things everyday.
